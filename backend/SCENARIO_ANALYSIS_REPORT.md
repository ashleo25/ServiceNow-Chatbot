## 🔧 **RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. Priority Assignment Enhancement:**
```python
Priority Rules Needed:
- "URGENT" + hardware failure = Priority 1 (Critical)
- "SECURITY" keywords = Priority 1 (Critical) 
- Multiple users affected = +1 priority level
- Board presentation impact = +1 priority level
```

### **2. Category Detection Refinement:**
```python
Category Mapping Improvements:
- "SECURITY ALERT" + "phishing" = Security (not Email)
- "monitor failed" + "URGENT" = Hardware + Critical
- Multi-user printer issues = Hardware + Medium priority
```

### **3. Business Impact Assessment:**
```python
Impact Factors:
- Executive/VIP users = Higher priority
- Multi-user issues = Elevated priority  
- Business-critical work = Escalated SLA
- Time-sensitive deliverables = Urgent handling
```
